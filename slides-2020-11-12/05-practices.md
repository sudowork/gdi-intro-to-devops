===

## Code ⟺ Build (Agile Development)

- Predates DevOps
- Iterative development of code
- Scrum teams, sprints, etc.
- Launch often
- Counter to "waterfall development"

## Code ⟺ Test (Continuous Integration)

Practice of automating integration of code changes reliably

- Code, Build, Integrate, Test
- Relies heavily on automated testing
- Integrate or merge code only if tests pass
- Tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, TeamCity, AWS CodeBuild

===

## Code ⟺ Release (Continuous Delivery)

Practice of automating releases so that they are _ready_ to be deployed to production

- Requires Continuous Integration
- Often abbreviated to CI/CD
- Often involves deploying to non-production environments
- Tools: Spinnaker, Jenkins X, Helm, Harness

## Code ⟺ Deploy (Continuous Deployment)

Practice of automating deployment of release _to production_

- Tooling the same as Continuous Delivery
- Biggest change is cultural
- More test coverage / confidence in prior CI/CD
- Dependent on better operations and real-time monitoring
- Rollback and recover automatically

## Operating and Monitoring

- Operating environment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Virtualization Inception: Docker containers, Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Monitoring and Dashboard tools: Prometheus, Nagios, Grafana, DataDog, Splunk, PagerDuty

## DevOps

It's not just tooling, practices or a role

It's also culture and philosophy and fundamentally changes how an organization operates
