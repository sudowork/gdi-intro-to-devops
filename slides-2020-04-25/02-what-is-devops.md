# What is DevOps?

===

## Technical Roles in Software (SaaS) Companies

- *Software Developer (Dev)*
    - Frontend Developer
    - Backend Developer
- *IT Operations (Ops)*
    - System Administrators
    - Database Administrators
    - Network Engineers
- Information Security (Sec)
- Quality Assurance (QA)

note:
- Talking primarily about Software as a Service companies
- Notion of writing the code in development vs operating the software in production
- Lots of different ways to define roles

===

## What it's not

- A person that does development and operations
- A set of specific tools or software
- Eliminating IT Operations
- Just a role/title

## One Definition

> DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The term DevOps was formed by combining the words ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù and ‚Äúoperations‚Äù and signifies a cultural shift that bridges the gap between development and operation teams, which historically functioned in siloes.

note:
- As you can tell, it's a pretty broad definition and includes some heady ideas around culture and philosophy.

## CALMS Framework

- Culture (collaboration, communication, organization)
- Automation of processes
- Lean operations (less process, feature bloat, etc.)
- Measurement of key performance indicators (e.g. time from dev to deployment)
- Sharing of feedback and knowledge (continuous learning)

## üßê Then What's a "DevOps Engineer"?!

Narrow definition of DevOps, but generally involves:

- Bridge between development and traditional operations
- Manages integration and release of code
- Focus on automation and tooling
- Oversees IT infrastructure
- Mixed skillset of system administration and software development
