note:
- Planning: Requirements gathering (PMs, Devs, etc)
- Analysis: Defining project goals, required functionality, what solution is needed
- Design: Architect optimal solution given requirements
- Implementation: Actual development (coding) and implementation of the design
- Testing and integration: Bring separate parts of project together, test for bugs, etc.
- Maintenance: Deployment happens and changes made as necessary based on feedback
- Notice it ignores operations

## Before DevOps

"Throwing code over the wall"

note:
- Think about how frustrating it would be for someone to hand you something that was broken
- Now think about if you kept getting woken up throughout the night and had to fix something you know little about
- Builds animosity from both sides

## So what's a "DevOps Engineer" do?

So someone says they do "DevOps" - what's that mean?

## Test

note:
- Mix of automated and manual testing
- Hopefully more automated
- The built code can be deployed to some environment for testing

===

## Release

note:
- Packaging the built code into shippable releases
- Not necessarily deploying them for use yet
- Release will have a version
- Sometimes ticketing system will be used

## Deploy
