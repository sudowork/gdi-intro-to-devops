## Course description

In this class, youâ€™ll learn what DevOps is, its core principles, how it came about, and common practices & tools used in the DevOps model. This class will be taught lecture style with opportunities for Q&A throughout.

We will cover the basics of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and cloud computing. We will examine how the traditional model of software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) works and how the DevOps model breaks the barrier between Dev and Ops in order to streamline the innovation and delivery of high quality software.

We will also be covering common skills, practices, and tools that are being used by DevOps practitioners. You will learn about DevOps practices such infrastructure as code (IaS), continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), and containerization, as well as how they conceptually fit into the software development life cycle. In doing so, we will briefly touch on modern tools that are used in industry today.
